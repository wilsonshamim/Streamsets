while using WholeFileTranformer stage (for converting avro to parquet file) in streamsets you might run into below issue

CONVERT_01 - Failed to validate record is a whole file data format : java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Record does not contain the mandatory fields /fileRef,/fileInfo,/fileInfo/size for Whole File Format.


solution:

you need to configure Data Format as "Whole File tranformer" in both origin and destination.
